Magento on OpenShift Express
==============================

This git repository helps you get up and running quickly w/ a Magento installation
on OpenShift Express.  It will be a clean installation where you will need to accept
the license agreement as well as configure your database connectivity and configure 
the admin user account.


Running on OpenShift
----------------------------

Create an account at http://openshift.redhat.com/

Create a php-5.3 application (you can call your application whatever you want)

    rhc-create-app -a magento -t php-5.3

Add MySQL support to your application

    rhc-ctl-app -a magento -e add-mysql-5.1

Add this upstream Magento repo

    cd magento 
    git remote add upstream -m master git://github.com/openshift/magento-example.git
    git pull -s recursive -X theirs upstream master
    # note that the git pull above can be used later to pull updates to Magento
    
Then push the repo upstream

    git push

That's it, you can now checkout your application at:

    http://magento-$yournamespace.rhcloud.com


NOTES:

GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy: This script is executed with every 'git push'.  
Feel free to modify this script to learn how to use it to your advantage.  By default, 
this script will create the database tables that this example uses. If you need to modify 
the schema, you could create a file GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/alter.sql and then 
use GIT_ROOT/.openshift/action_hooks/deploy to execute that script (make sure to back up 
your application + database w/ rhc-snapshot first :) )

The initialization steps will make changes to the files on the server side.  To pull 
those to your local repo, you can run 

    rhc-snapshot -a magento 

from your client, explode the resulting tar.gz and pull all the files from 
magento/repo/php back to your local magento/php directory.  It's always a good idea to 
take a snapshot every now and then.
